libtsm
==================================
``libtsm`` is a Python toolbox for time-scale modification (TSM) and pitch-shifting.

The toolbox is based on a re-implementation of the
`Matlab TSM toolbox <https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/resources/MIR/TSMtoolbox/>`_ by Jonathan Driedger and Meinard Müller.


If you use this toolbox, please cite the following
